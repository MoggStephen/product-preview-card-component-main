## My process

- Firstly set up the HTML
- I set up sass using a live compiler extension
- I set up the variables for certain colors and sizes using the designs
- Set up the elements flexboxes so that changing to desktop changes the elements appropriately
- Style the mobile version
- Style the desktop version

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Transform
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass.
- Hyphen delimited string class naming

### What I learned

- Used sass nesting and variables to develop the css.. Also learnt how sass comments and amperands for pseudoclasses work.
- Looked into google api for fonts and learnt that just importing the font doesnt import all the styles for the font!
- Learnt content css property
- I changed from camelcase to hyphen delimited string class naming as this is an industry standard!

### Continued development

- Continue working with sass.
- Continue class naming convention.
